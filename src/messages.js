        <span>Sure, if you want to be really specific. But I think you can also just call this <Label term={label}/></span>,

        <span>This is what you think <Query term={label} /> looks like? You're funny! I think this is supposed to be something like <Label term={label} /></span>,
        <span>Maybe. But I think this could also be <Label term={label} /></span>,

        <span>This is <Query term={query} /> according to you? üòÇ To me this looks more like <Label term={label} /></span>,
        <span>This is what you think <Query term={query} /> looks like? R U kidding? I think I can rather see <Label term={label} /> in there</span>,
        <span>Right, and I am a sentient human being. This clearly is <Label term={label} /></span>,
        <span>Now you're being delusional üôÉ. This definitely is <Label term={label} /></span>,
        <span>Haha...not in a million years. Clearly this is <Label term={label} /></span>,
