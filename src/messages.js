        <span>Now you're being delusional üôÉüôÉüôÉ. This definitely is {labelArticle} {labelEl}</span>,
        <span>Depending from what angle you look at it. Maybe. But I would rather go with "{labelEl}"</span>,

        <span>That's you üôà! {capitalize(queryArticle)} {queryEl} is better depicted by something this </span>,
        <span>Hahaha...you cannot make this üí© up! Where I'm from {queryArticle} {queryEl} looks like this</span>,
