# Deep Conversation

Great things have been achieved in the fields of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Many praising words have been written about the frontrunners. It is time to let them speak, to let them take part in the conversation and show off their skills. What would it sound like if Google Image Search and Google Cloud Vision had a conversation? A humorous investigation into the wit and intelligence of two of Google's most sophisticated algorithms.

## What?

This is the client part of a little experiment I made using Google's Image Search and Google's Cloud Vision APIs. In combination with its [server counterpart](https://github.com/Flave/Deep-Conversation-Server) it creates a conversation between these two algorithms. It runs a little react app that interacts with the server. Without server it's pretty useless.

## Development

```
$ npm run development
```

## Production

```
$ npm run production
```

## Deployment
Just put the build into the ~/html folder of any http server.
